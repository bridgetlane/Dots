<h2>Dots</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this multi-player game, the players are the subject of an unusual medical experiment only one of you will wake up from. Connect the dots while keeping your opponents from doing so in order to see the light.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience should be fun and interactive. The screen acts as a board, making the game people-interactive even though it is on a screen.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
2 or 4 player game. If there are 2 players, each player picks 2 colors. If there are 4 players, each player picks one color.
<br>Players can select or deselect any circle on the board for their turn. They can only choose to select or deselect ONE circle - that is their entire turn. You CANNOT pass your turn.
<br> If all 4 circles in a row or column are selected, the whole row/column will become locked (selected permanently). 
<br>The COLOR of the last circle selected in a row/column will decide who that row/column goes to. When the last circle is selected, the entire row/col will become the color of that circle. This row/col is now UNMOVEABLE.
<br>At the end of the game, the player with the most completed rows/cols of their color wins, and wakes up from their medical experiment.
<br><br>NOTE: Order matters. If you win a column, and a row is won, your column will be BROKEN by the row!
<br>System dynamics: The circles are unchangeable upon full row/column selection.
<br>Core mechanic: You can  select and deselect circles.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype explores strategy mixed with some unpredictability. This prototype also explores making a digital game that is multi-player focused, minimizing technology and maximizing player-to-player interaction. 
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because a row or column you win can easily be lost.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A daydream-like state reached by all subjects of the medical experiement.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The players are all subject of a unique medical experiment that has put you into contact, in a daydream-like state only one of you will wake up from. In order to wake up, you must beat your fellow experimental subjects at a mind game.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep an eye on your main colors and which of them are selected.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets made by me.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example.
